/**
 * How to launch the downloader.
 *
 * It used to be `spawn('npx', [...], { shell: process.platform === 'win32' })`,
 * to reach `npx.cmd`. But with `shell: true` Node does not pass an argv — it
 * joins the arguments with spaces into one command line and hands that to the
 * shell, without quoting any of them. The destination is
 * `%LOCALAPPDATA%\magictex`, so for anyone whose Windows account name has a
 * space in it the child saw:
 *
 *   ["download-assets", "C:\\Users\\Zoe", "Lin\\AppData\\Local\\magictex"]
 *
 * and the 480 MB first-run download went to `C:\Users\Zoe` — or failed. Every
 * such user hit it on their very first compile, which is the worst possible
 * moment for the tool to look broken.
 *
 * Quoting the path would work; not needing a shell works better. The package is
 * a dependency of this one, so its CLI is a file on disk we can run with the
 * node we are already running — no shell, no quoting rules, no PATH lookup, and
 * no npx reaching for the network to fetch something already installed.
 *
 * Exported so a test can check what would be launched without spending 480 MB.
