// Where a project's checkpoint history lives.
//
// Until now history required the project to already be a git repository, so
// anyone writing a paper in a plain folder got nothing — no timeline, no diffs,
// no record of what an agent changed. That is the feature this project exists
// for, absent for most of the people it is for.
//
// Telling them to run `git init` is the wrong answer: it puts a .git in their
// directory, changes what `git status` does there forever, and makes them adopt
// a tool they did not ask for to get a feature they did not know they were
// opting into. So for those projects the repository is one we keep ourselves,
// with the project as its work tree — git tracks the files, and `git` run there
// by the author still reports no repository. Verified on Windows git 2.45.
//
// It used to live in the per-user cache, keyed by a hash of the project path.
// That made history a property of the PATH rather than of the project, and every
// consequence of that was wrong:
//
//   - Rename or move the folder and the history was gone. Nothing said so.
//   - Reuse a path — delete ~/papers/draft, start a new paper with the same name
//     — and the new project silently adopted the old one's checkpoints. Restore
//     then wrote a deleted paper's files over the new one's, and the History
//     panel had been showing them as this project's own past all along.
//   - Copy a project and both copies wrote to one history.
//   - Delete a project and its full text stayed in the cache forever, with
//     nothing that would ever clean it up.
//
// Keeping the repo inside the project fixes all four at once, and needs no
// identity scheme to do it: the history is carried by the same bytes as the
// paper, so it moves, copies and is deleted exactly when the paper is.
// `.latex-preview` is already ours — already ignored by the watcher, the project
// collector and the export zip, and already excluded from checkpoints
// themselves.
