// Binding to 127.0.0.1 keeps other machines out. It does NOT keep out the
// user's own browser, and that is the whole problem: any web page they happen to
// visit can reach this server, because localhost is reachable from every origin.
//
// Nothing clever is required to exploit that. A cross-origin POST carrying a
// text/plain body is a CORS *simple* request: no preflight, so the browser
// delivers it and the server acts on it, and the sender never needs to read the
// reply. That reaches every mutating endpoint here — the file-system ops, the
// upload path and the checkpoint restore — each of which writes or deletes
// inside the user's paper. Reading is reachable too, via DNS rebinding, which
// makes an attacker-controlled name same-origin with this server.
//
// Three checks, each closing a different door. Removing any one of them
// reopens it; test/originGuard.test.ts fails loudly if you do.
