// Stopping the server must actually stop it, and any window still open must say
// so.
//
// Neither happened. `shutdownEngine()` and `stopWatching()` were both written and
// neither was ever called; there were no exit handlers at all. So Chromium, the
// preview server, its sockets and the file watcher were left to whatever the OS
// did — and when the process was not reaped, to nothing. A leaked server keeps
// watching the project and recompiling on every save.
//
// The visible half cost a round of debugging: a real "render failed" was reported
// from a window whose server had already died, while a healthy instance compiled
// the same paper fine on another port. Nothing on screen distinguished the two.
//
// This drives a real server, a real browser tab, then kills the server and checks
// both halves: the port is gone, and the tab knows.
