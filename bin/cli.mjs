#!/usr/bin/env node
// npm bin launcher. The server is TypeScript; register tsx's ESM loader in-process
// (no subprocess, so the MCP stdio channel is untouched), then start it.

// Check the Node version BEFORE importing anything, because the imports are what
// break. On an old Node this file failed inside tsx's own parsing, and an MCP
// client has no way to surface that — Claude Code shows a bare `-32000`, which
// says only "the server didn't start". A real user lost an hour to it: the cause
// was Node 12, and the first thing that ever said so out loud was an `npm install`
// warning buried in eighty lines of unrelated output.
//
// `engines` in package.json doesn't cover this: npm only warns, and never at run
// time. The floor is a real one — chokidar 5 needs >= 20.19.0 and playwright
// needs >= 20, so a Node 18 install would start fine and then silently stop
// live-reloading, which is worse than refusing to run.
//
// The floor is now READ from `engines` rather than restated here. It used to be
// two hardcoded numbers, and a later change added a second check in
// src/server.ts with a third — three floors, of which only this one could ever
// fire (ESM evaluates every `import` before a module body, so on an old Node
// chokidar throws long before src/server.ts reaches its own check).
//
// ./nodeVersion.mjs is written in old syntax on purpose and pulls in nothing, so
// static-importing it here is safe on the very Node versions being rejected.
